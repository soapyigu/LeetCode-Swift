/**
 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/
 * Primary idea: Recursive iteration, use outer iteration to count times, 
 *               use inner iteration to get the right string for specific index
 * 
 * Note: Swift does not have a way to access a character in a string with O(1), 
 *       thus we have to first transfer the string to a character array
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2), Space Complexity: O(n)
