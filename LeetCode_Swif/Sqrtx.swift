/**
 * Question Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/sqrtx/
 * Primary idea: Binary Search, right should start with x / 2 + 1, thus its square is x + x ^ 2 / 4 + 1,
 *               which is definitely greater than x
 *
 * Note: please use (right - left) / 2 + left to get mid in case of integer overflow
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(logn), Space Complexity: O(1)
